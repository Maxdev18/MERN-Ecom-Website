# MERN-Ecom-Website

# What is the application?
This is simply a practice project of full stack development. The site is using the MERN stack with multiple different languages. The site consists different techniques like REST APIs and the AJAX model. Also using the 3-teir architecture for complete full stack development. A login/registration form is also available using JSON Web Tokens for security and password hashing. The site doesn't include an admin panel/dashboard because it wouldn't increase my skill set too much since it would be really easy to make. The site is split up in 2 different servers, one for client side on port 3000 and one on the server side on port 5000. The 2 servers don't interefere with each other.

# Purpose
This project was made to help myself to learn more about back-end development and full stack development. Another reason is to improve my skills and ability to learn new modules and APIs quickly when needed like the paypal API. But most importantly, if anyone wants to take a look at my source code if they are also interested in making a full stack E-commerce application.

# What did I learn?
I have learned a lot from this project. Starting from zero knowledge about full stack development and piecing everything together, to actually understanding what each part does in the MERN stack, and to actually being able to use and understand models and project structures with bigger code base. I've also learned how to pass around data and user state like never before using HTTP requests and response headers. Another important thing which I finally learned is backend development. I never knew how much fun it could be in the backend, I'm not even being sarcastic. This project took awhile to finish the project because of life and other things but overall, definitly smarter, better, and faster than where I was before.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
If you have cloned the project, remeber to install necessary dependancies by running `npm install` or `npm i`\
before you run any of the later scripts shown below.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs both the front and back-end servers concurrently. This is the main script used to run both servers with one command.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
